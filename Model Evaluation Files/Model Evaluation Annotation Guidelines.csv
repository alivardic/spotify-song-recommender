Annotation Guidelines,
1,Look at the song recommendation provided in the spreadsheet.
2,"Listen to the song . You don’t have to listen to the whole track, but give it a fair chance (at least a portion of it) before deciding. For your convenience, a Spotify link is provided, but if you don’t use Spotify, feel free to listen on whatever platform you normally use."
3,Make a judgment:
,"If you liked the song, mark it as 1."
,"If you did not like the song, mark it as 0."
,"This is a subjective rating, and that’s intentional. You don’t need to justify your answer—just respond based on how the song makes you feel, for any reason."
4,"Record your response in the correct column of the spreadsheet, making sure it aligns with the appropriate song."
